# Agent Incident Recorder (A.I.R.)
## The VaultNode // Blackglass Continuum LLC

**Mission: Truth Preservation in Agentic Workflows.**

A.I.R. is a sovereign, finite-state observer that records AI agent actions and immediately flags out-of-sequence execution drift.

It does not judge intent; it strictly enforces state-transition correctness.

---

## Core Architecture

- **Input:** Agents POST a JSON payload representing state transitions after every execution step.
- **Logic:** The system cross-references these transitions against hardcoded, authorized JSON workflows.
- **Veto:** If a transition is unauthorized, the system flags an invalid state and generates a forensic Incident Report.

## The Law of Omission

This system explicitly refuses to implement predictive analytics, natural language parsing, probabilistic risk scoring, or hallucination loops.
